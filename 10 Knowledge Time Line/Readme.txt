All the timelines are basically list items


/* Create Line */

/* Boxes */
The Boxes of width 400px are created usind the div inside the li
A transition is added for the JavaScript

/* Right Side and Left Side*/
The left postion is changed for the div of the odd and even nth childs

/* Dots */
A dot of width and height 25px and circle shaped is created at the end of each list item
transition is used for JavaScript to turn the dots from white to secondary color

/* Arrows Base*/
Arrows are created by manipuating the border

/* Right Side Arrows */
Border widths are specified for each side differently

/* Media */
Two media queries created: 
1. For max-width = 900px:
   width of the box is reduced
   The Left boxes are pushed a bit to the left

2. For max-width = 600px:
   The line is pushed to the left side
   width of the box is reduced using calc function which takes 100vh of any sceen and subtracts 100px for the width
   The Left boxes are shifted to the right
   The left box arrows are reversed
