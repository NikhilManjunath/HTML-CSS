Grid is similar to FlexBox(can perform same functions), but is more complicated and powerful

Biggest difference is: Grid is capable of 2D layouts (more than 1 row/column)

Same align properties can be used like align-items and justify-content

display: grid;  /* grid */
all direct child elements are grid items

grid-template-columns defines width and number of columns

CSS Grid is used for outer elements and grid-like layouts

FlexBox - menu items, landing page
