unlike flex, display: grid does not automatically change items into a row

to do that we need to specify grid-template-columns
eg: grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px; -> 3 columns of width 200px

auto for any of the columns makes sure that that item fills the width of the remaining container

repeat(3, auto) -> 3 columns of same size such that they fill up the width
repeat(3, 200px) -> 3 cols of width 200px each

most common unit used for Grid is fr (fraction)

grid-gap is added for the spacing in between
