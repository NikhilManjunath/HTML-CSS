copy the font awesome link to all the pages
2 CSS sheets - style.css and utilities.css

link for utilities before link for style so that if we want to overwrite any utility stiles, it can be done

<a href="#home"> -> will go to that section of the page

position: fixed
top: 0px
-> the section always stays fixed at the top

font-weight makes the font bolder


for the header section, 3 flexboxes are used: one for the navbar, one for the links in the ul and one for the content.

For the header background to cover the enitre display, use 100vh as height
position: relative is used for overlay of the image (making the background image darker)

Although,
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center; 
  are used, the text wont align at the middle. 
  To make it align at the middle,
  height = 100% is used.

** For Overlay **
.hero::before {
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);  0.6 -> transparency
}

The text and the button are behind the overlay. In order to bring them front, we use z-index for everything inside the hero

** Icons **
Flexbox used:
 -> flex-direction: row (default)

** About Solutions **
Flex is used twice here
-> the class "row" contents are kept in a row and flex wrap is used so that after a certain size, the contents move to the next row
-> the contents of the class column are aligned in a column

object-fit: cover is used on the image so that the image is not stretched to fit the width. It instead covers the width smoothly

** Business Cases **
Again Flex is  used for this section similar to how it was used in the previous section

** Blog **
This section is same as the solutions section, only difference -> img on the right
Therefore flex-reverse is used

** Team **
This section is very similar to the Business Cases section so same properties are used

** Request Callback **
Again the section is same as the solutions section, hence same properties used


** Blog.html **
the links are changed from #about to index.html#about (because they belong to a different page)

Use the HTML for solutions section for all the three blog posts

** Post.html **
styling same as blog.html 
use display: block for image styling


** Adding a logo of the website on the title **
Google -> dynamic drive favicon -> open website -> choose image -> create icon -> download -> save it in EdgeLedger folder -> copy the link and paste it to the index.html page above the stylesheets
