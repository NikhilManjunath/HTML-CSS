Homepage of a website is always index.html

rel='stylesheet' implies we're importing a CSS file

header tag contains navbar and showcase.

navbar -> logo(h1) and navigation(ul)
** DONT HAVE MORE THAN 1 ID OF THE SAME NAME **
Since all the text in the navbar are links, add color specifically
A container is used inside navbar to make sure the text aligns at the middle

logo -> make sure it goes to homepage when clicked


CSS is done section-wise

Main Styling - styling core elements (body, p, h1)

Utility Classes are those which are used repeatedly. Acts like a framework, i.e. if we need to add more sections/pages to a website, we can use these classes instead of rewrting them again

showcase -> container used again
 - text-primary, lead and btn are utility classes

features -> icons taken from fontawesome.com (copy the link tag to use the fonts and paste it in the head section)
 - paste the link to the icons in the divs
 - change icon size using fa-3x(3 times bigger)

 ** clr must be done after float **

new CSS file for RL

1. In smaller devices, the Navbar links must be centered and vertical and smaller

Therefore float is removed and padding is reduced

2. In home info, change height in styles.css so it covers the entire text when the screen size is reduced

Also get rid of the image on smaller devices so that the text is not compressed and remove float

3. The 3 boxes also need to be vertical so remove float and increase width
