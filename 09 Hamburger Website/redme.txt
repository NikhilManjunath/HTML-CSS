Menu wrap is going to cover everything, including the overlay
position: fixed because when we croll down we dont want the menu toscroll down
z-index of 1 because we want it always on the top

Toggler/Checkbox is positioned such that it sits over the actual hamburger class but it is made invisible (opacity = 0)

Hambuerger class takes care of the box at the top-left

Inner div is used to create a line of width 100% and height 2px
Before and after pseudo selectors are used to create 2 more lines above and below the first line


We use transform and rotate to convert the lines into X when clicked
.menu-wrap .toggler:checked {} + .hamburger > div -> style will only be in effect when checkbox is checked and the style is on the div
First we make the lines rotate by 135deg when checked
Then we make the before and after lines to rotate by 90 deg


Transform scale(0) is used so that it appears only when checked
