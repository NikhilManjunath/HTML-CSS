Responsive Layouts is when we use HTML and CSS to make a website respond to different screen sizes, i.e. the website is user friendly on all devices

different ways to achieve Responsive Layouts:
 1. Set the viewport/scale - tells the browser how to handle page dimensions
 2. Use fluid widths - eg: Max-width
 3. Media Queries - specify CSS styles based on screen size
 4. Rem units over pix - multiplier of root HTML font size
 5. Mobile first method - website first designed for mobiles
