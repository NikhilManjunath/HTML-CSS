display: none; will make the tag dissapear

visibility: hidden; does the same function but the space will not be erased

commands in the class tag supersede the ones in the header tag i,e text color will remain blue even though its changed to red in the h1 section
To make sure class doesnt supersed, we use !important in the h1 section

Negative margin can be used
Negative Padding cannot be used
