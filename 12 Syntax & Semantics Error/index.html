  <h1><strong> Syntax Error vs Semantics Error </strong></h1>
  <h2><strong> Syntax Error</strong></h2>
  <p>A syntax error is a violation of the syntax/grammar of a programming language. A program will not compile until strict syntax is followed</p>
  <p>eg: In python, <br><strong> print(Hello World)</strong> is a syntax error <br><strong> print('Hello World')</strong> is the correct syntax </p>
  <br>
  <h2><strong> Semantics Error</strong></h2>
  <p>Semantics Error is a violation of the meaning of a programming language. These errors are not detected by the compilers. This is because, while the syntax of the code is valid, the logic being used is not.</p>

  <p>eg: <strong>sum = a-b </strong> is a semantic error because while the variable name suggests addition, the two numbers are instead undergoing subtraction </p>
