Keyframes are used to animate some property such as width, height etc.

animation-name: name of the animation
animation-duration: duration of the animation
animation-iteration-count: number of times the animation occurs
animation-fill-mode: forward -> will remain at the animated state
animation-delay: will wait for the specified time before animating
animation-direction: alternate -> forward direction; alternate-reverse -> reverse direction
animation-timing-function: ease-in ->slow then fast; ease-out -> fast then slow; ease-in-out -> slow-fast-slow

all of them can be executed in a single line:
animation: animation-name | animation-duration | animation-fill-mode | animation-delay | animation-direction | animation-timing-function
